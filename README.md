## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Nyra currently keeps its privacy model intentionally small and explicit:

- Bare domains open with `https://` by default.
- `nyra://settings` can disable HTTPS-first behavior for local/testing workflows.
- Web popups are blocked instead of being opened automatically.
- Site permission requests are denied by default until Nyra has user-facing permission controls.
- Only `mailto:` and `tel:` are opened through the operating system as external protocols.
- Unsafe typed schemes such as `javascript:alert(1)` are treated as search text, not navigation.

Persistent state is stored as `nyra-state.json` in Electron's `userData` directory. It currently contains settings, saved session tabs, and placeholders for future bookmarks and history.
